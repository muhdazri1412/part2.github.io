    <p align = "center" style="font-size:125%;">All paper submissions will be handled electronically. Papers must be submitted electronically in DOC format
    at <u style="color: #ff0000">easychair</u>. Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that
    are simultaneously submitted to a <u style="color: #ff0000">journal</u> or a conference with proceedings. Submitted papers will be peer
    reviewed and carefully evaluated based on originality, significance, technical soundness, and clarity of
    exposition.

    <br>
    <br>

    The submitted papers must be between 4-6 pages.   To facilitate the paper’s double-blind peer review
    process, authors should make efforts to ensure that information about the authors’ identities do not appear
    anywhere in the text-body of the paper and must follow the <u style="color: #ff0000">guidelines</u>.

    <br>
    <br>

    Upon acceptance, at least one of the authors listed in the paper must submit the final paper, attend the
    conference and present the paper according to the schedule of the conference. In the event that the presenter
    is unable to attend the conference for any reasons, your accepted paper will not be considered for submission
    of the proceeding to the <strong>IEEE Xplore</strong>.

    <br>
    <br>

    Accepted papers after further revisions will be invited for publications in selected journals. Please direct any
    questions about the paper submission process to the program chair at <a href="ict4m@iium.edu.my">ict4m@iium.edu.my.</a>.

    <br>
    <br>

    <strong>No Show Policy</strong>
    <br>
    Papers that are accepted must be presented at the conference, either by the authors themselves or via a proxy.
    In case a paper is not presented at the conference, it shall be deemed a <span style="color: #ff0000">‘no-show’</span>. Only presented papers
    will be submitted for indexing. <span style="color: #ff0000">No refund of the paid fees</span> may be claimed by the <span style="color: #ff0000">‘no-show’</span> author.
